By selecing the genre name of the genre type which fits to a certain production, and then taking the sum of the count from the inner select, and within that select counting the amount of ratings for that production from various users (we do not care which user rated what), we may reach the correct answer for this problem, as we are able to look at the number of ratings for each production, meanwhile inspecting what genre that production contains. In the end, we make sure we only look at genres with at least 10 total ratings to movies of that genre, by using the calculated sum of ratings.
