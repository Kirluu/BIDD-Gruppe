The equality is undefined as the right-hand side relation $R_{RHS}$ doesn't abide with the well-defined rule of cartesian product, which is that the relations must not have any common attributes. Even though a table like the above is created in MySQL when you try to select $id$ it won't know which $id$ attribute you are referring to.
For this equality to be true the $RHS$ should not rename the cpr in $R_2$.\\\\
