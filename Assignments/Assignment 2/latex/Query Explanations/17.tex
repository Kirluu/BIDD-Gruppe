This may be somewhat self-explanatory, however perhaps not entirely. At first, a selection is made to retrieve the Ids of all persons who have any acting role in the database. Followingly a similar selection is made to instead retrieve the Ids of all persons who have any director role in the database. Once these two selections are up and running, it's easy enough to note that we can count the amount of acting persons whose Ids also appear in the selection of persons with directing roles.
