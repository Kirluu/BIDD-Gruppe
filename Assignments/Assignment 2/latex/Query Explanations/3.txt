For this query to work we have to simulate a full outer join, or in terms of relational algebra the symmetric difference between two sets. We need to simulate this since MySQL doesn't have this function.
To simulate this functionality we create the joined set of productions where either John Travolta or Uma Thurman have had a role in. Then we create the set of productions in which both have worked together and then we negate the two.
