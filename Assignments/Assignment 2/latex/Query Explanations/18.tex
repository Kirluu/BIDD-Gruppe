By joining a single production with two different genres the way it is done here, we can count every single 2-genre combination that exists in the database. The outer select is only there to take the Ids found in the inner select and translating them to genre names rather than only the Ids being displayed. In the end, we would like to ignore the cases of productions having only a single genre (for instance "drama"), thus only looking at pairs of genres for all productions in the database.
