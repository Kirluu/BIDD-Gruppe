\subsection{$(\rho_{[cpr \mapsto id]}R_1) \times R_2 = (\rho_{[cpr \mapsto id]}R_1) \times (\rho_{[cpr \mapsto id]}R_2)$}

\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		$\bm{R_{LHS}}$ & $\bm{R_{RHS}}$  \\
		$(\rho_{[cpr \mapsto id]}R_1) \times R_2$ & $(\rho_{[cpr \mapsto id]R_1}) \times (\rho_{[cpr \mapsto id]R_2})$  \\

The equality is undefined as the right-hand side relation $R_{RHS}$ doesn't abide with the well-defined rule of cartesian product, which is that the relations must not have any common attributes. Even though a table like the above is created in MySQL when you try to select $id$ it won't know which $id$ attribute you are referring to.
For this equality to be true the $RHS$ should not rename the cpr in $R_2$.\\\\
